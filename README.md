# Deep Learning for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Drug Repurposing using Knowledge Graph and Multi-level Evidence 
AD-KG is a comprehensive knowledge graph relating genes, drugs, pathway, and phenotypes. The knowledge graph incorporates different source informaiton (CTD, AMP-AD, STRING, Agora). We utilized those information and combine Variational Graph Auto-Encoders to train the knowledge embedding to priortize AD effective drugs and further to identify some drug combinaiton for further testing.
